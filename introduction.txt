My name is Nathan. I recently tried coding with python and really enjoyed it. In fact, I enjoyed almost every python lesson. I learnt coding with python using turtle and pygame.
I decided to try coding with python in the first place as it seemed fun and there is an endless possibility of projects you can code out of python.
Furthermore, python is easy to understand, easy to read and also easy to edit too!
Why I decided to learn coding:
Actually, I never thought of learning to code in the first place before trying out coding to waste some time. But I actually ended up enjoying it, and made some cool stuff out of it.
Why do I enjoy coding? The reason is because you can use coding to do endless stuff. You can make a game, control robots, and even make your own website and so on!
Coding could be difficult, but once you finish a project, big or small, you would feel a sense of accomplishment.
